    <h2>Summary</h2>
    The world has ended long ago. You do not know the current year, but you do know the year when it all ended. 2012. <br>
    Nothing about this horrifies you. After all, it's all you've ever known. The only thing that matters is trying to achieve your goal. <br>
    Climate change has wrecked the earth, so weather changes on a dime, and extreme conditions are unavoidable. Resources are scarce, and they only get scarcer. Surviving in a world full of concrete monuments of old and metal long since rusted over is difficult, but not impossible. <br><br>
    <h2>Checkmarks</h2>
    LVL 1: You realize some of the equipment is still running. There's electricity.<br>
    LVL 2: You feel as if you are being watched. Supplies seemingly materialize out of nowhere.<br>
    LVL 3: A new person arrives- you've never seen them before. <br>
    LVL 4: You notice a robot, quietly arranging objects and setting down supplies. You somehow recieve a form of alien communication. <br>
    LVL 5: NPC discovers something they weren't supposed to and gets killed. Everything "Resets" but you remember. <br>
    LVL 6: Ohhhhh shittt it was some motherfuckers messing w you the entire time. the NPC is back but doesn't remember anything. They look fine. <br>
    LVL 7: Truman show and get their fucking ass. Become ungovernable. <br>
    LVL 8: Once you break free, you discover that the world did end. A climate crisis drove humanity into bubbles and shit. You are robots tasked with cleaning up the earth as it was left. <br>
