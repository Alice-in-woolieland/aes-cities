    <h1>The world is harsh and yet you still continue.</h1>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    90% of humanity has died from a virus. Humans however, keep on living. <br>
    Self contained city-states have become the one safe haven between swaths of dangerous lands. Rouge police AI roam the steets from an era long gone- their instructions; shoot to kill. <br>
    For various reasons you have left your hometown on a dangerous mission to reach the hidden land of Alexandria, a fabled city safe from outer threats. <br>
    What are you willing to sacrifice to get there? What lengths are you willing to go to?<br>
    In this futuristic post apocalpse where AI is no longer controlled by a central authority and no one can be trusted, you must fight, scheme and solve your way into the secret city of Alexandria.
    <h2>Players</h2>
    This is a world ruled by technology and logic. Magic isn't something that exists- everything must have a scientific explaination. This doesn't mean miraculous things cannot occur- all technology, (especially those surrounding Alexandria) are much further advanced than anything we have in our current day.
    <h2>Alexandria</h2>
    Alexandria is a research lab, containing tons of information now lost to humanity. A collaboration created by humanities greatest minds now lays crumbling. The hivemind AI, running without human intervention for years, continues it's never ending maintainence. The small quirks of the system continuing to pile up as the decades go by. <br>
    No person can get into Alexandria alone, they must be recognized as a Citizen by the AI. Gaining Citizenship is a task that no one so far has completed, but that doesn't make it impossible, not by any stretch of the imagination.
